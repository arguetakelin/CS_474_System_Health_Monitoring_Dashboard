The System Health Monitoring Dashboard is a web-based application designed to monitor and display critical system metrics, including CPU usage (user, sys, and idle), memory usage, process, and load average.

I will use Flask, and Twilio as an external API to notify users when their system metrics cross defined thresholds. 

Functions: 
• Monitor CPU, memory, process, and load average. 
• Display real-time metrics through a web UI.
• Display charts to show the 
• Send alerts via SMS when specified thresholds are exceeded.
